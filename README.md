# coverletter_writer
A simple program to streamline the cover letter writing process with AI assistance.

This program was made to make the automation of bulk cover letters faster.
This program does the following:
- Pulls my resume information from a text file I've made.
- Takes information from the job posting (currently manual. Webscraping is planned).
- Gathers the above information, and sends it to chatGPT to generate a cover letter.
- Automatically copies the cover letter to clipboard.

TODO:
- Implement grammarly assistance to refine the text (Partially complete)
- Improve the prompt to generate a better (less generic) cover letter
